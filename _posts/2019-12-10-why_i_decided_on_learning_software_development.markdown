I decided to learn software devlopment because I like being isolated with the computer and learning about the things you can do with it. Also, I love the feeling of being able to read code as if it was normal paragraphs of text. Another reason is I have always wanted to learn how to apply my ideas in software development to one day help someone. Lastly, teaching myself for the past 6 months has made me come to the conclusion that i love to code!
