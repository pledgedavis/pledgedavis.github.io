     Creating my CLI project was not an easy task as i had to choose a website that interested me or not. As i found the website scraping the elements was probably a much bigger challenge for me but once i started using pry and the other Web IDE resources, like Repl, to see what value the link's are holding; it made scraping a lot easier understanding what it was that i am scraping. Also,  when it came to giving my movies attributes with attr_accessor it was a simple task for me because of the countless lessons and labs of "Object Orientation". Another lab that helped me out on this project would be the “Tic Tac Toe” lab; it helped me with decorating what the user will see and how to ask for the users input. Overall the CLI project was a tough assignment that i'm proud to of worked on and completed.
