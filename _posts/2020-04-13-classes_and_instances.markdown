   To my understanding the most important thing about a class and instances is that they both rely on eachother. A class relies on an instance so the instance can provide functionality throughout the class but at the same time the instances need the class for structure because without the class they would just be instances without a purpose and structure. Also if needed to you would not be able to use any of those instances in another method without them being inside of a class because they are only instances. And another important thing is without instances the class would have no properties so if you wanted to ever try to use the class like `User.age` or `User.name` you just would not be able to because the class would need instances which provide the traits that you would have to define within that class to be available.
