This final project was indeed a tough one. During the time I built this last application I came to the conclusion that it is best to always take the long way when building out an application. For instance, as I started out building my rails backend, I found it a lot easier to not use a scaffolding generator. Because building out most of the files allowed me to create the backend in what seemed like a sequence of events which added less space for error since I know what is going on in every file. That being said applying this flow of handling things one after another I ended up building the frontend in an almost similar pattern. First of course starting with building out all of my necessary files and folders then separating the react and redux parts as much as I could for better clarity of what’s going on while also learning on the go. While building this application the building blocks for instance components are basically JavaScript classes while containers are just placeholders for things you would like to render from inside of your components. I also learned about props and state on this journey. Props are ironically just that “properties” of a object. Which ended up coming in great use because if props did not exist there wouldn’t really be a way to pass a child component inside of a parent component and displaying properties correctly without the use of props. Then while using state, I learned that it is the best alternative to wanting to change an object inside of a component since props are only readable. Lastly, I came to the conclusion that when building out any application it’s best to go step by step like as if you are cooking your favorite meal because skipping around will most likely ruin the meal.
