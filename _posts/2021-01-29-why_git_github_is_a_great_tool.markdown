During my time being a student at Flatiron I have learned that GitHub and Git are probably two of the best and most important tools while programming and learning.
## GitHub
GitHub is basically a social networking site for programmers which allows users to post projects public or private. It also allows you to work on your projects with help from others and from almost anywhere in the world! While using GitHub you will quickly realize that it's almost like having a developer Instagram or Facebook but instead of uploading posts about pictures you can upload posts about your code or view others as well. Another great thing to note about GitHub is its ability to save your work inside of what GitHub calls a "Repository". Repositories are great because they can be anything you want for whatever your post is about for instance, the repository can contain folders, files, images, spreadsheets, and data sets. Lastly, a README is usually added for information about your post.

**Fork and Clone**
GitHub also comes with two features: fork and clone. In GitHub terminology "to fork" means to keep a personal copy of someone's repository on your online GitHub account. "To clone" means to simply copy a repository that lives on your computer instead of the server.

## Git
Git in a nutshell is a Version control system which means it allows us to manage project files. Git and GitHub are similar because they both keep track of your work except while using Git you will notice everything can be handled locally rather than in the cloud like GitHub. Maintaining everything locally allows you to use Git without an internet connection other than when you need to download it. Git's main focus is to help keep track of your source code then it is up to you to decide on whether you'd like to send that code to GitHub for everyone to see.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, although GitHub and Git work together GitHub just allows you to do a lot more with your stored data. I cannot stomach how many times GitHub has saved me from losing my precious code. These two tools are very important for that reason they both defend against losing work with just a save! So not only are both of these tools free but they are useful. I hope this article helped you see how useful and important Git and GitHub are.
